#Portfolio project
Hello! This is my portfolio project.

##Idea.
Build a live portfolio that will get updates as I am learning more. 

##Requirements
What I am using is the following:
deployment: Jekyll framework
HTML5 for content
CSS for style, Flexbox for the layout model

##Plan
More or less:
1. build a static web page
setup gulp into project dir
choose a template to take inspiration from
create home page layout
create home page content 
build layout with CSS Flexbox
style the page 
2. once it is finished. deploy it with jekyll on GitHub


### Day one
Today I started the portfolio project. I want to create a portfolio using my own CSS so that I can learn how to hand code my own CSS, not just using bootstrap because using it from the beginning won’t help me to understand front-end. I can use later on for sure, when I get more comfortable. 

9:07 am - Installed Gulp – build tool that automatize tasks such as refreshing the browser page whenever I save a file in my project directory. Now I am going to configure it by following CSS Tricks’ own tutorial.

3:07 pm – I’m still configuring Gulp, it’s taking more time than I expected but damn I think it’s worth it. So far I’m learning how to setup a build tool, which I would have had to do it sooner or later, then I had a first approach to Sass, which is quite good. And I learned how to setup a split screen in Ubuntu. 

7:27pm -finished to install and configure Gulp. It took me an entire day, and what I’ve done is just a small part of what Gulp can do. Wow. 

### Day 2-5
Built page layout the first time by using normal CSS, then I learned more about Flexbox so I decided to use its layout model to rebuild the page.

### Day 6
Today I improved the layout after researching for modern portfolio pages. It is starting to look decent.
